React implementation of [Minesweeper Game](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)>) optimized for large board.

The project is using [Bulma](http://bulma.io) for basic styling.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to play?

Select the board parameters of your preference (number of rows, columns, and bombs), and press on a smile button to create a gaming board.

Select a cell and click on it. At this point, the bombs will be distributed through the board (so you don't lose the game with the first click).

Once you click on a bomb the board will open board cells, and the game will be lost (the button will indicate ðŸ˜µ)

If you find all bombs on the board (open all the hint cells), the button will open the board calls as well, but the state of the button will show that you have won -- ðŸ˜Ž

Feel free to put flags (ðŸš©) with right mouse click for your convenience.

To restart the game press the button again.
